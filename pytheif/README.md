## Pytheif is a python keylogger ( apologies for the weird names ). 

##### This keylogger is completely built with python. The main idea behind building the keylogger is to use in my upcoming project which is a reverse shell.
##### As a result of my reseach on AV evasion, figured out some methods that can be used to build FUD reverse shells. I am working on the revese shell and hopefully will be able to finish it very soon.

##### I'll upload the standalone compiled version on the keylogger very soon

### Thank you :)
